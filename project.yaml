# Project Description.
desc: >
  Our project is an interactive K-Means Classification Visualizer. It supports
  K-means for points in 1D, 2D, 3D, and beyond. The interface allows users to 
  offer a CSV file containing points they wish to classify, otherwise they may 
  run the program on sample points or randomly generated points. Users may also 
  choose their own value of k or let the model find the optimal value of k.
  
  This project is available in GUI and I/O versions.
  The GUI version supports data visualization and statistics, and the I/O version 
  supports an extra k-Nearest Neighbors functionality on a new user-provided point.
