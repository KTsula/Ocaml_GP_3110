  - ChatGPT citations:
    ChatGPT was helpful and used for querying about GUI functionality when there was low documentation on libraries such as lablgtk3 and plplot. We found it was able to fill in the gaps that the githubs for the libraries did not fill in answering questions about how to use the libraries. ChatGPT, version 4o, OpenAI, chat.openai.com.
